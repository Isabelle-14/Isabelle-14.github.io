        <h2>My name is Isabelle Hunt. I am 21 years old and am currently a student through MIT's women's cohort for full stack developement.</h2>
        <h2>I am very excited to traverse into the tech world. Learning through this course is opening up so many doors for me and gives me something new to be excited about.</h2>
        <h2>I only work retail at the moment, but for most of my life I have had the interest in tech but never was brave enough to get started in it. Through this course I have learned that my dreams can be a reality through a lot of work and practice. I
            hope that through my time in this course I can develope this website to show off my skills.</h2>

            <p>Eye Movement: In this activity I got to dive into the usage of mouse events. I had to cause a set of eyes to follow my mouse around the screen. The activity was very satisfying to accomplish. In the future I would like to possibly move on
                to having something follow the mouse around the screen.</p>

            <h3 style="color:aquamarine;">Pacmen</h3>
            <p>Pacmen Factory: This activity makes use of a loop to create PacMen moving at random speeds on command. Everytime the "Add PacMan" button is clicked, a new PacMan is added to your screen. Once you press the button "Start Game", the PAcMen move
                in random directions at different speeds across the screen. They bounce off the screens edges and keep moving about on the page. As they are moving you can keep adding as many PacMen as you'd like. In the future I would like to add onto
                this project by making the PacMen change direction each time they hit an edge, and also possibly make them change color as well.</p>

            <p>Bus Tracker Activity: This activity makes use of pulling a map of Cambridge from MapBox and adding custom markers along the route between Harvard and MIT. I had never done anything like this before so getting to use an access token and using
                MapBox was a very interesting task. In the future I think I would like to integrate this to my own home town and possibly tracking my commute to family and friends houses.</p>
